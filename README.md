The purpose of this site: To show my projects and promote me to potential employers.

What an employer might be looking for: Good code structure and coding practices, 
frequent and good commits, well commented code, someone that's good at meeting deadlines and 
holding timelines and finally someone who's able to work in teams and socially at the workplace.

What I would look for as an employer: See above. (Might add more when I figure it out)
